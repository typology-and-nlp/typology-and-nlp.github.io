A long-standing research goal in Natural Language Processing (NLP) is the development of robust language technology applicable across the world's languages. However, this goal has not been met yet. One of the main causes is the inherent variation of the cross-lingual data (with respect to categories and structures). This results in poor performances of NLP algorithms when applied to a large scale, as their design, training, and hyperparameter tuning suffer from language-specific biases.

Linguistic typology holds promise to solve this problem. This field of study compares all languages systematically, and documents their variation in publicly available databases. Typological information from these databases has already provided guidance to multilingual NLP algorithms for feature engineering and data selection/synthesis.

However, typological information has not yet been fully exploited, as experiments were mostly limited to few features (mostly related to word order) and to few tasks (mostly dependency parsing). Moreover, typological databases are wanting in coverage and their interpretable, absolute, discrete features cannot be integrated straightforwardly into the state-of-art NLP algorithms, which are opaque, contextual, and probabilistic.

Our workshop aims at bridging this gap by encouraging a tighter collaboration of the scientific communities from the areas of linguistic typology and multilingual NLP. Moreover, we aim at fostering research in the following open problems: 1. Achievement of actual language-independence in algorithmic design. 2. Integration of typological features in joint multilingual / language transfer settings. 3. Automatic inference of typological features. 4. Interpretation of representations within multilingual neural models through typological knowledge.
